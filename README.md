# VBA-challenge

This author was tasked with analyzing three years of generated stock market data.

The VBA script loops through all stock records for one year and calculates (for each ticker symbol):
* yearly price change
* yearly percent change
* total stock volume

The results are outputted to a summary table.
To aid visualization, the script formats positve change with a green background and negative change with a red background.

Then, the script loops through the summary table and calculates the ticker symbol with:
* Greatest percent increase
* Greatest percent decrease
* Greatest total volume

The results are outputted to an additional summary table.

All of the above is executed for each year of information.
